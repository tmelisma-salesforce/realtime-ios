/// Manages the long-lived Pub/Sub API subscription to OpportunityChangeEvent
///
/// IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: Ready for gRPC integration
///
/// This manager is structured to handle real-time CDC events via bidirectional streaming.
/// The gRPC client code has been generated in `Realtime/Generated/pubsub_api.grpc.swift`.
///
/// TO COMPLETE:
/// 1. Add pubsub_api.grpc.swift to Xcode project
/// 2. Create HTTP/2 transport: HTTP2ClientTransport.Posix(target: .hostAndPort("api.pubsub.salesforce.com", 7443))
/// 3. Initialize client: Eventbus_V1_PubSub.Client(wrapping: GRPCClient(transport: transport))
/// 4. Call client.getTopic() to get schema ID
/// 5. Call client.getSchema() to fetch Avro schema
/// 6. Call client.subscribe() with bidirectional streaming:
///    - Send FetchRequest messages with topicName and numRequested
///    - Receive FetchResponse messages with events
///    - Decode Avro payloads using SwiftAvroCore
///    - Call onEventReceived callback
/// 7. Implement exponential backoff retry on disconnection
///
/// See PUBSUB_GUIDE.md for complete protocol details.
/// See SWIFT_SALESFORCE_PUBSUB.md lines 280-395 for Swift examples.
