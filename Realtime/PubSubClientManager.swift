/// Manages gRPC client connection and schema caching for Salesforce Pub/Sub API
///
/// NOTE: This implementation is structured for grpc-swift-2 integration.
/// The generated client code exists in `Realtime/Generated/pubsub_api.grpc.swift`.
/// Full gRPC implementation requires:
/// 1. Add pubsub_api.grpc.swift to Xcode project target
/// 2. Use Eventbus_V1_PubSub.Client<Transport> for RPC calls
/// 3. Configure HTTP/2 transport with TLS to api.pubsub.salesforce.com:7443
/// 4. Implement auth interceptor for metadata headers
///
/// See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md Phase 7 for complete integration guide.
